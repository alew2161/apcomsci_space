# apcomsci_space

space themed program


* libgdx
* watch a tutorial or something
* No idea how to clone, merge, etc; don't even get me started on merge conflicts.
* Watch those two videos or you won't know/won't survive anything.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCGmXVCvogY
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcsAuGauqIk
* The first video ensures that Android/Gradle works and that your Eclipse workspace is set up correctly
* The second video (first part) tells you how to import the data (must build gradle framework)
